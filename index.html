    Hello my name is Jacob Sierra, I am a 30yr old Full Stack Developer. I completed my studies at 
    the University of Texas, San Antonio. I love taking on new challenges and learning new skills, taking a coding
    course was definitely a challenge but I am a quick learner and picked up fairly quick.
    When I am given a new project I give my all to complete it as requested, I am self driven and very dedicated.
    These are the skills I learned along the way
